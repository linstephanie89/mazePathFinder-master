# mazePathFinder
This program implements A* search algorithm to find the shortest path in a maze. There are several modifications made to the program including observing a smaller g-value, larger g-value, and adaptive h-value.

Features
- Maze Exploration: The path finder is designed to explore unknown mazes, where the layout and obstacles are not known in advance. It dynamically discovers the maze structure as it progresses.

- A* Search Algorithms*: The project implements various A* search algorithms, which are well-known pathfinding algorithms that intelligently explore the maze to find the shortest path. These algorithms use heuristics to guide the search and make informed decisions about which paths to explore next.

- Optimal Path Identification: By utilizing the A* search algorithms, the path finder is able to identify the most optimal path from the starting point to the destination. It considers factors such as distance, obstacles, and possible alternative routes to find the most efficient solution.

- Machine Learning Integration: The path finder leverages machine learning techniques to improve its performance over time. It can learn from previous maze traversals and optimize its search strategies accordingly. By continuously refining its approach, the path finder becomes more efficient and accurate in finding optimal paths.
